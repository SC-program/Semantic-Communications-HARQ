# A unofficial code of ``Deep source-channel coding for sentence semantic transmission with HARQ"
Requirements: tensorflow>=2.10, pickle
Unzip ``tokenizer_5000_1.zip" before running SC(500bits).ipynb and SCHARQ(CRC).ipynb

**Sim32 will be added in the further. I am working towards semantic communication techniques and may reproduce more semantic techiques. Let's make progress together :) **
